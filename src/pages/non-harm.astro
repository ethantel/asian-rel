                From the Sanskrit word meaning “non-harming” or “non-injury,”
                ahimsā is a central tenet in Buddhist ethics and practice,
                acting as the principle of refraining from causing any type of
                harm to any living being.

                In light of what many deem should be exceptions, such as eating
                plants and animals or acting in self-defense, ahimsā emphasizes
                a commitment to caution and mindfulness, in that one should
                reduce and refrain from harm when possible, practicing caution
                in cases of unintentional violence, avoiding excessiveness if it
                is necessary and being mindful of inflicting pain on others.

            Living during the time that the Buddha walked the Earth, there was a
            blood-thirsty murderer who terrorized and killed many innocent
            people, chopping their fingers off and stringing them together to
            make a necklace, and thus becoming known as Angulimala (translated
            as Finger Necklace).
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Having obtained 999 fingers, he noticed the Buddha in proximity and
            sought him out to complete his collection. Although the Buddha
            simply and serenely walked unhurriedly ahead of him, Angulimala
            found that he could not catch up, and eventually exhausted,
            frustrated, and angry, he yelled at the Buddha to stop.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            The Buddha turned with neither anger nor fear and directly
            responded, "Angulimala, I have stopped forever, I abstain from
            violence towards living beings. But you have no restraint towards
            things that live. That is why I have stopped and you have not."
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Moved by his words, Angulimala immediately throws down his weapons
            and takes refuge in the Buddha, becoming a monk and following his
            teachings.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">
            His life as a monk was met with many vengeful attacks by people who
            remembered his past, yet he understood and never retaliated against
            them, for the Buddha explains to him that this was the consequence
            of his actions and that these attacks are his karmic debt being paid
            off.
          </p>
          <p>
            Angulimala's path to enlightenment shows the Buddhist principle that
            no one is inherently and permanently evil beyond redemption, and
            that non-violence is the ultimate path to escape one's suffering,
            proving that attaining enlightenment is possible in even the most
            extreme circumstances.
