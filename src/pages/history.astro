          <p class="text-neutral-700 mb-6">
            The son of a king, born and raised on what is now the Indian-Nepalese border, Siddhartha Gautama was the prince in a relatively privileged and wealthy family. Growing up sheltered by his father, who confined him to their palace to protect him from the outside world, he became disillusioned with his comfortable lifestyle, a sense of suffering in the form of sickness, old age, and death troubled him greatly. As past pleasures hollowed into empty memories, he left home, adopting the life of a wandering ascetic to embark on a religious and spiritual journey.          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-700 mb-6">
            After learning under various teachers and practicing extreme austerities, he remained unsatisfied with his journey, until experiencing an awakening that marked the end of his spiritual journey. While seated in meditation beneath an asvattha tree, the deepest understanding of the nature of suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the path leading to its cessation overtook Siddartha Gautama. 
          </p>
          
          <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-primary-500 pl-4 italic text-lg my-8">
            "Buddhism cannot be explained unless we accept that it has its origin in the strong personality of its founder."
            <footer class="text-neutral-700 mt-2 text-sm">— Étienne Lamotte</footer>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p class="text-neutral-700">
            Becoming the Buddha, he devoted the rest of his life to teaching the path to cessation of suffering to groups of wanderers and willing householders. By the time of his death, he had established a well-organized community, extracting considerable support from a vast population of followers, Buddhism was born.
