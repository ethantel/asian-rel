            Understanding Not-Self (Anattā)
          </h2>
          <p class="text-neutral-700 mb-6">
            The source of the deepest dukkha (suffering), anattā is a term
            describing the idea that there is no unconditional self within our
            own constructed sense of self, revealing our worst anguish and
            challenging our fundamental assumptions regarding our identity and
            existence.
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-700 mb-6">
            When we deeply examine our experiences and thoughts, we find that
            there is no core, fundamental substance that can be classified by
            “I” or “me.” In awakening to our constructedness and then
            deconstructing our sense of self, we find the only real solution to
            our most fundamental source of anxiety.

            “Not being a real self is intrinsically uncomfortable. Not being a
            real self is also what enables the sense of self to be deconstructed
            and reconstructed, and this deconstruction/reconstruction is what
            the Buddhist spiritual path is about.”

            <p class="text-neutral-700">
              This understanding of anattā gives us some insight into karma,
              emphasizing the role of one’s motivations and intentions. When
              your sense of self is reconstructed and you become a product of
              your own habitual ways of perceiving, thinking, feeling, and
              behaving, karma becomes who you are, rather than something you
              simply possess.

          <p class="text-neutral-700">
            Buddha emphasized the importance of knowing both what we are and
            what we aren't. This understanding leads not to nihilism, but to a
            profound liberation from the constraints of rigid self-identity and
            the suffering it creates.

          Together, this set of khandas is a way to describe everything we can
          know and experience, becoming a useful way of exploring how clinging
          and attachment cause suffering. Confronting these five aggregates and
          using them in practice as objects for mindfulness, as well as
          realizing that they are impersonal and impermanent, helps us to let go
          of our attachments that revolve around them, allowing our insights
          into impermanence to develop and deepen further.

            Money is a socially constructed symbol bound into the notion of
            self. Because Buddhism teaches that there is no inherent, permanent
            self, the idea that one's identity, worth, or control can be
            maintained through material wealth is completely illusory.
          </p>
          <p class="text-neutral-700 mb-6">
            Material attachments inevitably lead to ignorance, attachment, and
            delusion (the three poisons, pictured left). Recognizing and
            understanding anattā helps to cultivate a contentment with wealth as
            an illusion by loosening our ego's grasp on material objects as
            symbols of success and identity, thus diminishing greed and the
            three poisons as the root of one's suffering.

            "Money is not a thing but a process. Perhaps it's best understood as
            an energy that is not really mine or yours. Those who understand
            that it is an empty, socially constructed symbol can use it wisely
            and compassionately to reduce the world's suffering. Those who use
            it to become more real end up being used by it, their alienated
            sense of self clutching a blank check—a promissory note that can
            never be cashed."
